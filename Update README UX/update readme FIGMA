# UI/UX

## Overview
This Figma Prototype is designed to showcase the flows that have been designed. You will see the high fidelity mockups, the primary functions of the flow, and future flows for implementation.

### How to Use
1. **Access the Prototype**:
   
You can interact with the prototype at the following link: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/qzRo0T1FIRIp2FkBZtXKey/SHIFT-UI?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=65-514&viewport=817%2C-4082%2C0.16&t=vVdNABqel4mhStHB-1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=65%3A514&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design)

   
3. **Navigate Through the Prototype**:
   
You have a left bar and a top bar. 
The left bar will help you to move through each designed flow. They are organized by:
- A. Login
- B. Company
- C. Candidate
- D. Association

2.1 The top bar gives you the option of how to preview the screen. Please go to Options > Fit width.

2.2 To go to the next flow, select the next title in the left bar.

2.3 If you want to go back again and restart the whole flow, press “R”.


3. **Feedback and Comments**:
   
- You must be logged in to Figma to comment.

- The comments will remain in the file unless you click "Resolve" in the right bar that appears after you add a comment.

### Key Features
Not every button or interaction is prototyped. Therefore, we have added some videos in the file to have the full explanation. By clicking on the screen, you can see hints highlighted in blue of what is clickable.

You can see here in the following link the recorded videos with each flow designed: [Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TGAIahEZZUoSioJJA6W8hqKnIHvJiBja?usp=drive_link)
